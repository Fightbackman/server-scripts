# Contribution guide
## First: Thank you for your support
Let us thank you. You help us to improve this project and make it to something very everyday usable.

## Script Design guide
Please have a proper look at our [Script Design Guide](https://github.com/Fightbackman/server-scripts/ScriptDesignGuide.md).
There is everything you need to know about designing scripts for this project.

## Issue Tracker
We commonly use the issue tracker in german but it is no problem to post your issues in english. But try to avoid other languages. Google translator doesn't make it easier to help you with your problem.
We would like it if you submit issues with the syntax:
```
$script_name / $script_section / $your_problem
```
This allows us to exactly locate your problem or improvement suggestion.
