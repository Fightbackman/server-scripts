# Script Design Guide

## Introduction
This guide aims to give you a simple view of how to write scripts for this Repository.

## Validation/Checking
We prefer if you use the [Shellcheck-Linter](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck)
to fit in a mostly compatible way to bash and sh.
You'll find a installation guide for your editor in their repository.
